Oh, how he loves it when I smile,
Smile away the pain he afflicted.
Cleansing his conscience of all the sins he commited to my mind
soul
and     body
All there remains are remnants of love, ruins.
Your love ruined me,
Erased the child in me
Alas a woman awakes from her slumber 
to tear out the boy in you
and put him to good use
You never knew what it meant to care or to nurture a dying thing
When you held me 
and I couldn't hold you back
Did you see it then?
What broken feels like 
But you tried
didn't you?
To rebuild the walls of this Jerusalem 
You called it 
                Us
It took a while, but I realised 
that U and I couldn't be together
Even if we rearranged 
           the A l p h a b e t
